Once in a blue<sub>-cheese</sub> moon, you get a chance to do something great. This is not one of those times.

It sounds cheesy, but I'm going through a honeymoon phase with machine learning and try to learn as much as possible. Today's project is a bit of a moonshot. I'll be aiming to fool a CNN into thinking that a picture of the moon is actually a picture of a cheese.

## Image classifier
I'll target the pre-trained `ResNet-50 v1.5` from ðŸ¤—HuggingFace https://huggingface.co/microsoft/resnet-50
